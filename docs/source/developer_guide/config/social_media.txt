===================
Social Media Logins
===================

NoDonuts allows users to either create a NoDonuts-only account or to log in
using social media. Currently the project supports the following log-ins:

* Facebook
* Google OpenId
* Twitter
* Yahoo OpenId

This section explains how to configure each of the four types of social media
log-ins.

Google and Yahoo
================

Google and Yahoo work with an out-of-the box installation of NoDonuts and do
not require any further configuration.

Facebook
========

By default, Facebook is disabled and will not show up as an option for users
trying to log in. In order to use Facebook for authentication, you need to
obtain an authorization key and secret using a developer account.

.. note::

Developer accounts on Facebook require a user account that has a confirmed
unique mobile telephone number. You cannot confirm a Facebook account using a
land line, a VOIP account, or a mobile phone that is associated with another
user.

Getting a Developer Account
***************************

To create a developer account, go to the `Facebook App creation page`_. Click
'Register Now' and if  you haven't confirmed your phone it will ask you to do
so at this time.

Creating a New Facebook App
***************************

From the `Facebook App creation page`_, click the 'Create New App' button.  You
should see a form that looks something like this:

.. image:: /_static/img/facebook_create_app.png

Fill out the form using your own values and click 'Create App'.

At the top of your Dashboard page you should see the name and icon for your
app, along with two fields, ``App ID`` and ``App Secret``.

Copy those two values into your ``srv_settings.py`` file:

::

    SOCIAL_AUTH_FACEBOOK_KEY = '...your App ID...'
    SOCIAL_AUTH_FACEBOOK_SECRET = '...your App Secret..'

Go to the 'Settings' panel and edit the 'Basics' tab.  Enter your email address
in the ``Contact Email`` field (this is required to be able to use Facebook to
log in). Click 'Add Platform', choose 'Website', and configure the url where
your NoDonuts app will be hosted.  Don't forget to save.

If you are doing local development and don't have an external server to work
with, you can fake an external url by editing your ``/etc/hosts`` file:

.. img::/_static/img/etc_hosts.png

.. img:/_static/img/faked_url.png

Facebook will treat the faked url the same way it would a normal external url.

Advanced Tab

Finally, to make your app public,


Twitter
=======

By default, Twitter login is desabled and will not show up as an option for
users trying to log in.

.. note::

    Please read the developer agreement for Twitter carefully. It has several
    mandates related to your privacy policy and your terms of service that you
    must comply with. You should update the privacy and terms statements to
    fit their minimum requirements.
