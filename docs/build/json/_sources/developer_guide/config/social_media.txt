===================
Social Media Logins
===================

NoDonuts allows users to either create a NoDonuts-only account or to log in
using social media. Currently the project supports the following log-ins:

* Facebook
* Google OpenId
* Twitter
* Yahoo OpenId

This section explains how to configure each of the four types of social media
log-ins.

Google and Yahoo
================

Google and Yahoo work with an out-of-the box installation of NoDonuts and do
not require any further configuration.

Facebook
========

By default, Facebook is disabled and will not show up as an option for users
trying to log in. In order to use Facebook for authentication, you need to
obtain an authorization key and secret using a developer account.

.. note::

Developer accounts on Facebook require a user account that has a confirmed
unique mobile telephone number. You cannot confirm a Facebook account using a
land line, a VOIP account, or a mobile phone that is associated with another
user.
