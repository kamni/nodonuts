Searching Recipes
=================

NoDonuts uses a plugin called Haystack to manage searches, and a search engine
called Whoosh to index all of its recipes.

.. note::

    Currently there is a bug in django-haystack that causes errors during
    update to cascade across all other updates. Until this is fixed in the
    main version of django-haystack, this project uses a custom fork of the
    project.  Please see references below for a link to the forked project.

The search page is located at `/search/`_. There are four GET parameters that
can be used with the search:

:dfn:`q`
    Keyword search terms. These will match any recipes that have these terms in
    the title, ingredients, or tags.
:dfn:`tags`
    Tag literals, separated by spaces. These will match the tags in a recipe
:dfn:`ss`
    Serving size -- i.e., how many people this recipe will serve. The number
    entered must match one of the following:

    * 0: 1-2 people
    * 1: 3-4 people
    * 2: 5-6 people
    * 3: 7-9 people
    * 4: 10-12 people
    * 5: 12-15 people
    * 6: 15-20 people
    * 7: 20-30 people
    * 8: 30-50 people
    * 9: More than 50 people

    These options can be found in recipes.models.ServingSize. People using the
    search will not have to enter these numbers manually, as the form provides
    a dropdown with the appropriate options.
:dfn:`order`
    Order that the tags should be returned. The options currently are:

    * popularity
    * newest
    * alphabeta (alphabetical ordering A-Z)
    * alphabetz (alphabetical ordering Z-A)

    These options can be found in recipes.forms.RecipeSearchForm.
